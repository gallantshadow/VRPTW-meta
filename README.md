# Project README

## Dependencies:
- pypy3

## Installation:
To install all the necessary packages for this project, ensure you have pypy3 installed. Then run the following command:
```bash
pypy3 -m pip install <package1> <package2> ... <packageN>
```
Replace `<package1>`, `<package2>`, etc., with the names of the necessary packages.

**Note:** If you decide to use Python 3 instead of pypy3, it's essential to keep the number of iterations below 10,000 in `main.py`. This limitation is to ensure optimal performance and prevent potential issues with resource consumption.
